## 📘 Project Overview

This project analyzes the performance of an **Online Learning Platform** using SQL and Python.

We explore how users interact with courses, identify high-performing instructors, detect drop-off points in the student journey, and analyze revenue, completion trends, and engagement across different regions.

The final notebook — `Online Course Platform Analysis Overview.ipynb` — contains detailed queries, charts, and insights that simulate a real-world data analyst case study.

## 🧩 Problem Statements Solved

We answered **10 key business questions**:

1. 🔝 What are the most popular course categories?
2. 🎓 What is the completion rate per course?
3. ⭐ Which courses are the top-rated?
4. 📈 What is the monthly trend of enrollments?
5. 🌍 What is the student distribution by location?
6. 🚻 How does course completion differ by gender?
7. ❌ Which categories have the highest dropout rate?
8. 💰 Which categories generate the most revenue?
9. 👨‍🏫 Which instructors perform best in terms of enrollments and ratings?
10. ⏱️ How long does it take users to complete a course (on average)?

## 🧠 Key Findings

- **Data Science and Design** are the most popular and high-revenue categories.
- Some courses have **excellent completion rates**, while others suffer high dropout, especially in long-duration or technical categories.
- **Instructor performance** varies widely; some have high enrollments but lower ratings.
- Users in major cities contribute most enrollments, but some emerging cities show growth potential.
- Gender-wise, there's a consistent trend of completion across all demographics.
- On average, learners take **20–60 days** to complete a course — with variation based on category and difficulty.
